This is the Stylish project as a whole, linking to the individual
language bindings and the editor integration.

A historical note:

Stylish used to be Perl-only and Emacs-only, but now it has branched
out.  The Emacs stuff is at https://github.com/jrockway/stylish-elisp
and the Perl stuff is at https://github.com/jrockway/stylish-perl.
